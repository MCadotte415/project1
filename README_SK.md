# How does a person's salary compare to their years of experience?


## Percentage of minimum years of experience

* Majority of the population can be found in the first bucket of a minimum of 0-5 years of experience. This might suggest frequent job chnages. 
* You can also see that each bucket gets smaller as the years of experience increases, which might support the notion that not very many people stay 
within the same role for too long.


## Range of salary based on the minimum years of experience

* The last bucket of 17-20 minimum years of experience, which only consists of one person, has the lowest median.
* While the median is the highest in the 11-17 category, it also has the largest range (with the highest salary overall but also low salaries as well).
* When comparing the first two buckets, the 0-5 bucket has a higher median and overall range than those of the 6-10 bucket.

* These three points support the earlier implication about frequent job searches. 
* It also suggests that more tenure does not necessarily mean a higher salary, unfortunately.


## Final Thoughts
* All of this being said, the dataset we used was a sample of about 500 resumes within the entire working population in India. Therefore, the results 
and conclusions drawn may not reflect what is true of the actual Indian population. 
* Several different factors may play into a person's salary, e.g. education
* Our findings were a result of the buckets we manually created, so different patterns may have been found had we bundled them differently.
