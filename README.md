boot camp project 1
I explored how salaries differed between career paths. I had to further clean the file provided by removing excess data and focusing my results to six fields so the data visuals were not overwhelming and taking away from the presentation. I choose Accounting, Banking, Pharma, Education, Advertising, and IT-Software. Overall the salary average and median were fairly similar cross the fields except for Pharma which was much higher than the rest and in fact the highest paying indutry.  Education had the largest range in pay from $1,542 to $6,753. Accounting was the shortest range. It-Software however was the largest job market and accounted for over 3/4th of all the jobs in the data.  My finding was that while not the highest paying industry working in IT-Software still had a higher median and average pay then the rest of jobs making it the most prosperise industry.
